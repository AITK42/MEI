# P-IV-2-1

In order to execute the program please use an IDE similar to IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code.

## File Encryption/Decryption:

In the first step the password is requested, followed by the path of the input file and the path of the output file.

The user then chooses if they wish to encrypt or decrypt the input file inserted in the second step.

In case the user wishes to encrypt a message, the input file must be a file with the message in plaintext. If the user wishes to decrypt a file, the input file must have an encrypted message.

## Code execution example:

File example: message.txt with message "helloThere"
